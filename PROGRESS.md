# Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing the player system from PLAN.md.

## Completed Tasks

- **Task 1: Player Setup** - Created PlayerController.cs script with Rigidbody constraints and CapsuleCollider setup (component properties own initial values), child transforms creation, and debug gizmos for bounds visualization.
- **Task 1a: Camera Setup** - Added camera setup steps in PLAN.md and implemented camera look integration in PlayerController.cs with mouse sensitivity, invert Y, angle clamping, and mouse locking/unlocking via Menu/Use actions.
- **Task 2: Input System Integration** - Created PlayerControls.inputactions asset, generated PlayerControls.cs class, integrated input handling in PlayerController.cs with handler methods, camera look, and debug logging.
- **Task 3: Ground / Ceiling Checks** - Implemented CheckGrounded() using Physics.Raycast (center + 8 circle), CheckCeiling() using upward raycasts (center + 8 circle), added configurable parameters, and debug gizmos for visualizing checks and ground normal.
- **Task 4: Walk & Run** - Implemented HandleMovement() for input to velocity conversion, added configurable walkSpeed and runSpeed, and debug gizmos for velocity vector.
- **Task 4a: Direction Responsiveness** - Implemented velocity smoothing with acceleration/deceleration logic, added faster deceleration on direction reversal, configurable parameters, and debug gizmos for smoothed vs raw velocity.
- **Task 5: Jump (with Buffer + Coyote Time)** - Implemented jump buffer, coyote time, variable jump height, configurable jump parameters, and debug gizmos for jump apex line and timer visualization.
- **Task 6: Crouch + Crouch Jump** - Created PlayerCrouch.cs with grounded/midair crouch mechanics, capsule adjustments, camera height lowering, speed reduction, ceiling check prevention, and debug gizmos for capsule dimensions and crouch state. Fixed camera offset maintenance from collider top, ceiling raycast detection with debug visuals, and auto-uncrouch when moving out from blocked areas.
- **Task 7a: Smooth Terrain Navigation** - Implemented terrain navigation in PlayerMovement.cs with raycasts in movement direction to detect slopes, velocity adjustment to align with terrain normals, configurable parameters for raycast distance, number of rays, slope alignment strength, and player heights. Added debug gizmos for visualizing slope detection rays.
- **Task 8: Ladder Climb** - Created PlayerClimb.cs with climbing mechanics, trigger volume detection with layermask filtering, gravity disable during climbing, movement along ladder axis based on input, exit on jump or ladder end, and debug gizmos for ladder bounds and climbing axis. Integrated with PlayerMovement to disable normal movement during climbing. Enhanced with horizontal movement (left/right) and ladder-relative vertical movement (forward/backward input controls up/down based on direction toward/away from ladder).
