# Implementation Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing the player system from PLAN.md.

## Completed Tasks
- **Task 1: Player Setup** - Created PlayerController.cs script with Rigidbody constraints and CapsuleCollider setup (component properties own initial values), child transforms creation, and debug gizmos for bounds visualization.
- **Task 1a: Camera Setup** - Added camera setup steps in PLAN.md and implemented camera look integration in PlayerController.cs with mouse sensitivity, invert Y, angle clamping, and mouse locking/unlocking via Menu/Use actions.
- **Task 2: Input System Integration** - Created PlayerControls.inputactions asset, generated PlayerControls.cs class, integrated input handling in PlayerController.cs with handler methods, camera look, and debug logging.
- **Task 3: Ground / Ceiling Checks** - Implemented CheckGrounded() using Physics.SphereCast, CheckCeiling() using upward spherecast, added configurable parameters, and debug gizmos for visualizing checks and ground normal.
- **Task 4: Walk & Run** - Implemented HandleMovement() for input to velocity conversion, added configurable walkSpeed and runSpeed, and debug gizmos for velocity vector.
- **Task 4a: Direction Responsiveness** - Implemented velocity smoothing with acceleration/deceleration logic, added faster deceleration on direction reversal, configurable parameters, and debug gizmos for smoothed vs raw velocity.
